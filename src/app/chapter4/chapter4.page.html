    One of the last things we did was ride bikes along the PCH bike trail. We
    started at Santa Monica Pier and rode all the way down to Marina Del Ray. We
    ate a quaint little brunch place in Venice and then found a Vegan Ice Cream
    shop to boot! We took more pictures as the sun began to set over the water,
    but this time posing with bikes. I couldn’t have asked for a better ending
    of one year and the beginning of another. I am so blessed to have the
    opportunity to experience life on the other side of the country with family.
    Maybe someday, I’ll find myself living in California. Until then, I am going
    to keep these fond memories of mine forever.
